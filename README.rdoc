= nested_has_many_through

This has been floating around for a while:

* http://code.torchbox.com/svn/rails/plugins/nested_has_many_through
* http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/6461

I'm packaging/refactoring it up in a plugin with specs

== Why?

The current implementations are really poorly speced/tested, and the lastest patches don't seem to apply on edge.
